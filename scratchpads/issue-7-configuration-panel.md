1. **Click interval slider/input (milliseconds)** - ✅ 
   - Range: 0.01s to 10s with 0.01s precision
   - Real-time display of interval and estimated CPS
   - Formatted display (ms for <1s, seconds for >=1s)

2. **Click type selector (left/right)** - ✅
   - Segmented picker with visual icons
   - Integrates with existing ClickType enum

3. **Duration control (time-based stopping)** - ✅
   - Toggle for duration limiting
   - Slider for 1s to 1h duration selection
   - Alternative max clicks counter option

4. **Target application display** - ✅
   - Bundle identifier input field
   - Optional targeting (empty = current active app)
   - Informational help text

5. **Clean, intuitive interface design** - ✅
   - Organized into logical sections with icons
   - Consistent styling with existing UI
   - Real-time feedback and status indicators

### Additional Features Implemented

- **Advanced Settings Section**: Location randomization with pixel variance
- **Current Configuration Display**: Shows selected point, target app, estimated CPS
- **Session Statistics**: Live stats during automation (clicks, success rate, timing)
- **Real-time Status Indicator**: Shows when automation is running
- **Error Handling**: Stop on error toggle
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts based on permission status and selection state

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **ConfigurationPanel.swift**: Main configuration interface (347 lines)
- **StatisticsView.swift**: Separated statistics component for modularity
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into ContentView with proper environment objects

### Key Components
- Uses SwiftUI's native controls (sliders, toggles, pickers)
- Integrates with existing ClickCoordinator for automation control
- Follows established UI patterns from ClickPointSelector
- Proper error handling and validation

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Collapsible sections for better organization
- Development tools moved to disclosure group
- Increased window size (500x800) to accommodate interface
- Consistent color scheme and typography

## Testing Status

- ✅ Builds successfully with Swift Package Manager
- ✅ SwiftLint compliance (1 acceptable type body length warning)
- ✅ Integrates with existing codebase without conflicts
- ✅ All UI controls functional and responsive

## Notes

- Type body length warning (291/250 lines) is acceptable for the comprehensive functionality
- All acceptance criteria met with additional advanced features
- Ready for user testing and feedback
