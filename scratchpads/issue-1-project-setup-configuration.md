# Issue #1: Project Setup and Configuration

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/jsonify/clickit/issues/1

## Analysis

### Current State
- Swift Package Manager project partially configured
- Basic SwiftUI app structure with ContentView
- Framework imports in place (CoreGraphics, Carbon, ApplicationServices)  
- AppConstants.swift with required framework and permission constants
- Project structure directories created but incomplete

### Build Issues Identified
1. **Package.swift Configuration**: Test target has overlapping sources with main target
2. **Resources Handling**: Unhandled resource directory at `/Sources/ClickIt/Resources`
3. **Target Structure**: Need to properly separate main executable from test targets

### Requirements Analysis
From issue #1:
- ✅ SwiftUI project structure (partially done)
- ❌ Universal binary target (needs verification)
- ❌ macOS 15.0+ deployment target (needs verification)
- ✅ Project folder structure (basic structure exists)
- ✅ Required frameworks (imported in AppConstants.swift)
- ❌ App icon and branding (missing)
- ❌ Successful build on both architectures (currently failing)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Package.swift Configuration
1. **Fix Target Configuration**
   - Remove overlapping sources between main and test targets
   - Ensure test target only depends on main target, not on source files directly
   - Configure proper resource handling

2. **Verify Universal Binary Support**
   - Check Swift package platform configuration
   - Ensure proper deployment target (macOS 15.0+)

### Phase 2: Complete Project Structure
1. **Create Missing Directories**
   - Ensure all planned directories exist
   - Add placeholder files where needed to maintain structure

2. **Add App Icon and Branding**
   - Create basic app icon for macOS
   - Add to Resources directory
   - Update Package.swift to handle resources properly

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Test Build Process**
   - Verify successful build with `swift build`
   - Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon if possible
   - Run tests with `swift test`

2. **Verify All Acceptance Criteria**
   - Universal binary support
   - macOS 15.0+ deployment
   - Proper folder structure
   - Framework integration
   - App icon presence

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Fix Package.swift
- Remove source file references from test target
- Ensure test target only depends on main target
- Configure resources processing correctly
- Set proper platform requirements

### Step 2: Complete Resources Setup
- Create basic app icon (can be simple for now)
- Add to Resources directory
- Ensure proper resource bundling

### Step 3: Validate Structure
- Create any missing directories with `.gitkeep` files
- Ensure clean separation between UI, Core, and Utils modules

### Step 4: Test Build
- Run `swift build` to verify compilation
- Run `swift test` to verify test configuration
- Check for any remaining configuration issues

## Expected Outcomes

After completion:
- Clean, successful builds on both architectures
- Proper project structure established
- All required frameworks integrated
- Basic app icon present
- Foundation ready for core functionality implementation (Issue #2)

## Notes

- The project structure is well-planned and follows the PRD requirements
- Most framework imports are already in place
- Main work is fixing configuration issues and adding missing assets
- This sets the foundation for implementing actual auto-clicker functionality
