# ClickIt

A lightweight, native macOS Auto-Clicker application with precision timing and advanced targeting capabilities. Designed for gamers, automation enthusiasts, and productivity users who need reliable, accurate clicking automation.

## Features

- **Native macOS Application**: Built with SwiftUI for optimal performance
- **Universal Binary**: Supports both Intel x64 and Apple Silicon
- **Advanced Window Targeting**: Works with any application, even when minimized
- **Precision Timing**: Sub-10ms click timing accuracy with customizable intervals
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows click points with overlay indicators
- **Preset System**: Save and load custom clicking configurations
- **Global Hotkeys**: System-wide controls for start/stop operations
- **Variable Timing**: Human-like randomization patterns
- **Background Operation**: Continues operation without requiring app focus

## Use Cases

- **Gaming**: Automated clicking for various games and applications
- **Testing**: UI testing and automation workflows
- **Productivity**: Repetitive task automation
- **Accessibility**: Assistance for users with mobility limitations

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- Accessibility permissions (for mouse event simulation)
- Screen Recording permissions (for window detection and targeting)

## Installation

[Installation instructions will be added once the app is ready for distribution]

## Development

This project supports both Xcode and Swift Package Manager workflows for flexible development.

### Quick Start

#### üéØ **For Development**
```bash
# Open in Xcode for development
open ClickIt.xcodeproj
```

#### üèóÔ∏è **For Building and Running**
```bash
# Build (auto-detects best method)
./build_app_unified.sh

# Run the built app
./run_clickit_unified.sh

# Or run directly with Xcode
./run_clickit_unified.sh xcode
```

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- macOS 15.0 or later

### Build Commands

#### Unified Build System
```bash
./build_app_unified.sh              # Build release version
./build_app_unified.sh debug        # Build debug version  
./build_app_unified.sh release xcode # Force Xcode build system
```

#### Traditional Swift Package Manager
```bash
# Build for current architecture (debug)
swift build

# Run directly
swift run

# Build for release
swift build -c release
```

#### Legacy Build System
```bash
# Create universal app bundle (Intel + Apple Silicon)
./build_app.sh

# Create debug app bundle
./build_app.sh debug
```

### Run Commands  
```bash
./run_clickit_unified.sh            # Auto-detect best run method
./run_clickit_unified.sh app        # Run from dist/ClickIt.app
./run_clickit_unified.sh xcode      # Build and run with Xcode
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Daily Development**: Use Xcode for coding, debugging, and testing
2. **Release Builds**: Use `./build_app_unified.sh release` for distribution
3. **Quick Testing**: Use `./run_clickit_unified.sh` for fast app launches

### Build Output Structure
- `dist/ClickIt.app` - Final app bundle
- `dist/binaries/` - Individual architecture binaries
- `dist/build-info.txt` - Build metadata
- `.build/` - Swift Package Manager build cache

### Universal Binary Support
The build system automatically detects available architectures and creates universal binaries when possible:
- **Intel x64**: `x86_64-apple-macosx`
- **Apple Silicon**: `arm64-apple-macosx`
- **Universal**: Combined binary supporting both architectures

### Code Signing for Permission Persistence

The build script automatically attempts to code sign the app to improve permission persistence. This helps avoid having to re-grant Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions after each rebuild.

**Automatic Signing:**
The build script will automatically:
1. Look for ClickIt-specific certificates first
2. Fall back to any available Apple Developer certificates
3. Display the signing status in the build output

**For Self-Signed Certificates:**
If you don't have an Apple Developer account, you can create a self-signed certificate:
```bash
# See detailed instructions
cat CERTIFICATE_SETUP.md
```

**Verify Code Signing:**
```bash
# Check if app is signed
codesign --display --verbose dist/ClickIt.app

# Verify signature
codesign --verify --verbose dist/ClickIt.app
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
swift test

# Build and test specific configuration
swift build -c release
swift test -c release
```
