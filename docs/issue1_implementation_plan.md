# Issue 1: Project Setup and Configuration - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation steps for Issue 1, which establishes the foundational project structure and build configuration for ClickIt, a native macOS auto-clicker application.

## Requirements Analysis
From the PRD:
- macOS Version: 15.0 or later
- Universal binary support (Intel x64 + Apple Silicon)
- Development Stack: Swift/SwiftUI
- Required Frameworks: Core Graphics, Carbon, ApplicationServices

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Creation
- Create new macOS SwiftUI project
- Configure for universal binary target
- Set minimum deployment target to macOS 15.0
- Enable necessary build settings for both architectures

### 2. Framework Integration
- Add Core Graphics framework
- Add Carbon framework for hotkey support
- Add ApplicationServices framework for window management
- Configure framework linking in build settings

### 3. Project Structure Setup
Create the following directory structure:
```
ClickIt/
├── UI/
│   ├── Views/
│   └── Components/
├── Core/
│   ├── Click/
│   ├── Window/
│   └── Permissions/
└── Utils/
    ├── Constants/
    └── Extensions/
```

### 4. Basic App Configuration
- Create app icon meeting macOS requirements
- Configure basic branding elements
- Set up Info.plist with required permissions

## Validation Criteria

### Build Configuration
- [ ] Successful build on Intel Mac
- [ ] Successful build on Apple Silicon Mac
- [ ] Correct macOS deployment target (15.0+)

### Project Structure
- [ ] All required directories created
- [ ] Proper group organization in Xcode
- [ ] Clean separation of concerns

### Framework Integration
- [ ] All required frameworks properly linked
- [ ] No linking errors in build
- [ ] Framework imports working

### Visual Assets
- [ ] App icon in correct formats
- [ ] Basic branding elements in place

## Technical Notes
- Framework versions must be compatible with macOS 15.0+
- Universal binary requires specific build settings
- Project structure supports future implementation of all PRD requirements

## Next Steps
After completion:
1. Verify all acceptance criteria
2. Document any setup requirements
3. Prepare for Issue 2 (Permissions System) implementation
