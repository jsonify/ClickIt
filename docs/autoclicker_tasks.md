## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for MVP (End of Milestone 4)

- **Functional**: Clicks accurately at user-defined points in Roblox
- **Controllable**: ESC key starts/stops reliably
- **Stable**: Runs for gaming sessions without crashes
- **Performant**: <50MB RAM, <5% CPU at idle
- **User-Friendly**: <30 seconds from launch to first click

## ðŸ”„ Post-MVP Iteration Planning

After MVP completion, prioritize features based on user feedback:
1. **High Priority**: Variable timing, better presets
2. **Medium Priority**: Conditional logic, pattern recording  
3. **Low Priority**: Multi-point support, cloud sync

## ðŸš¨ Critical Dependencies & Risks

- **macOS Permissions**: Test early and often, prepare fallbacks
- **Window Targeting**: Core functionality - needs robust testing
- **Global Hotkeys**: Potential conflicts with other apps
- **Performance**: Monitor closely during development
