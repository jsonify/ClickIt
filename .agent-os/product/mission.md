## The Problem

### Inconsistent Clicking Performance

Existing auto-clickers lack precision timing and reliable performance across different macOS applications. Many solutions fail when target windows are minimized or in the background, disrupting user workflows.

**Our Solution:** Native macOS integration with sub-10ms timing accuracy and universal app compatibility.

### Poor macOS Integration

Most auto-clickers are cross-platform solutions that don't properly integrate with macOS security models, window management, or native APIs, resulting in unreliable performance and security warnings.

**Our Solution:** Built specifically for macOS using native Swift, CoreGraphics, and ApplicationServices frameworks.

### Limited Background Operation

Users need clicking automation to continue working even when target applications are minimized or hidden, but most solutions require constant window focus and manual intervention.

**Our Solution:** Process-ID based clicking that works with minimized windows and background applications.

### Complex Setup and Configuration

Existing tools have complicated interfaces, poor permission handling, and unclear setup processes that frustrate users and create barriers to adoption.

**Our Solution:** Intuitive SwiftUI interface with streamlined permission management and visual feedback systems.

## Differentiators

### Native Performance Architecture

Unlike Electron-based or cross-platform auto-clickers, ClickIt is built entirely with native Swift and macOS frameworks. This results in sub-10ms timing accuracy, minimal resource usage (<50MB RAM), and seamless system integration.

### Universal App Compatibility

Unlike game-specific or browser-only solutions, ClickIt works with any macOS application through advanced window targeting and process-ID based clicking. This enables automation across native apps, web browsers, and games without compatibility issues.

### Background Operation Excellence

Unlike focus-dependent clickers, ClickIt maintains full functionality even when target windows are minimized, hidden, or in the background. This allows users to continue other work while automation runs uninterrupted.
