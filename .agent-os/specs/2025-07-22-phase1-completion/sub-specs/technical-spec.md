# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-22-phase1-completion/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-22
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Pause/Resume Controls
- **UI Integration**: Add pause/resume buttons to main automation control panel with proper state management
- **State Preservation**: Maintain session statistics, elapsed time, and configuration during pause state
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensure pause state is reflected immediately in all UI components and visual feedback overlays
- **ElapsedTimeManager Integration**: Leverage existing pause/resume functionality in ElapsedTimeManager for consistent time tracking

### Enhanced Preset System
- **Data Persistence**: Use UserDefaults for preset storage with structured data format supporting all configuration parameters
- **Preset Validation**: Implement validation logic to ensure saved presets contain valid configurations before allowing save/load operations
- **UI Components**: Create preset management interface with save/load/delete functionality and custom naming capability
- **Configuration Mapping**: Ensure all ClickItViewModel properties are properly serialized/deserialized in preset system

### Error Recovery System
- **Error Detection**: Implement comprehensive error monitoring for click failures, permission losses, and system resource issues
- **Recovery Strategies**: Develop automatic retry mechanisms, permission re-checking, and resource cleanup procedures
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error notifications with recovery status and recommended user actions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure system remains stable and responsive even during error conditions

### Performance Optimization
- **Timing Accuracy**: Optimize click timing loops to achieve sub-10ms accuracy using high-resolution timers and minimal overhead operations
- **Memory Management**: Profile and optimize memory usage to maintain <50MB RAM target during extended operation
- **CPU Efficiency**: Minimize background processing overhead to achieve <5% CPU usage at idle
- **Precision Testing**: Implement automated performance benchmarking to validate timing accuracy and resource usage

### Advanced CPS Randomization
- **Human-like Patterns**: Implement configurable timing variation using statistical distributions (normal, uniform) for natural clicking patterns
- **Variance Configuration**: Add UI controls for randomization amount and pattern selection
- **Pattern Prevention**: Ensure randomization prevents detectable automation signatures while maintaining user-specified CPS targets

## Approach Options

**Option A: Incremental Enhancement**
- Pros: Low risk, maintains existing functionality, easier testing and validation
- Cons: May not achieve optimal integration, potential for architectural inconsistencies

**Option B: Comprehensive Refactor** (Selected)
- Pros: Clean architecture, optimal integration, better long-term maintainability, addresses all features cohesively
- Cons: Higher complexity, requires more extensive testing, longer development time

**Rationale:** Option B provides the foundation needed for Phase 2 features and ensures all Phase 1 features work together seamlessly. The existing codebase is well-structured and can support comprehensive enhancement without breaking changes.

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required**
- **Justification:** All functionality can be implemented using existing Swift frameworks (Foundation for UserDefaults, CoreGraphics for precision timing, SwiftUI for UI components)
- **Alignment:** Maintains the project's zero-dependency philosophy for security and simplicity

## Implementation Architecture

### Preset Management Components
- **PresetManager**: Centralized preset storage and retrieval using UserDefaults
- **PresetConfiguration**: Codable struct containing all automation settings
- **PresetSelectionView**: UI component for preset management interface

### Error Recovery Components
- **ErrorRecoveryManager**: Monitors system state and implements recovery strategies
- **ClickItErrorHandler**: Centralized error handling with automatic recovery attempts
- **SystemHealthMonitor**: Background monitoring of permissions and system resources

### Performance Optimization Components
- **HighPrecisionTimer**: Enhanced timing system for sub-10ms accuracy
- **PerformanceProfiler**: Real-time monitoring of timing accuracy and resource usage
- **CPSRandomizer**: Advanced randomization engine with configurable patterns

## Integration Points

- **ClickItViewModel**: Enhanced to support pause/resume state and preset management
- **ClickCoordinator**: Updated with error recovery hooks and performance monitoring
- **ElapsedTimeManager**: Extended integration with pause/resume UI controls
- **AutomationConfiguration**: Enhanced to support randomization and error recovery settings
