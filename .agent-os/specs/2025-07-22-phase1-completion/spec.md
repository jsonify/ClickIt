## Overview

Complete the remaining critical features for ClickIt's MVP Phase 1 release, focusing on user experience polish and production-ready stability. This includes pause/resume controls, enhanced preset management, comprehensive error recovery, and performance optimization to meet sub-10ms timing targets.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Automation Control
As a user running long automation sessions, I want to pause and resume clicking automation without losing my configuration, so that I can temporarily interrupt automation for other tasks and resume seamlessly.

**Detailed Workflow:** User starts automation, needs to pause for a meeting or other task, clicks pause button, automation stops but configuration remains active, user returns and clicks resume, automation continues from where it left off with the same settings and statistics tracking.

### Preset Management System
As a frequent ClickIt user, I want to save my automation configurations with custom names and quickly load them later, so that I can efficiently switch between different clicking setups for different applications or tasks.

**Detailed Workflow:** User configures click location, timing, duration, and advanced settings, clicks "Save Preset" button, enters custom name like "Gaming Auto-Farm" or "UI Testing Sequence", preset is saved and appears in preset list, later user selects preset from dropdown and all settings are automatically loaded.

### Reliable Error Recovery
As a user depending on automation for critical tasks, I want the system to automatically recover from errors and continue operation, so that my automation doesn't fail due to temporary system issues or permission changes.

**Detailed Workflow:** User starts automation, temporary permission issue or system resource constraint occurs, system detects error, automatically attempts recovery strategies, provides user notification of recovery actions, continues automation seamlessly or gracefully stops with clear error reporting.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pause/Resume Controls** - UI buttons and logic to pause/resume active automation while preserving session state and statistics
2. **Enhanced Preset System** - Save/load configurations with custom naming, validation, and preset management interface
3. **Comprehensive Error Recovery** - Automatic error detection, recovery strategies, and graceful degradation with user feedback
4. **Performance Optimization** - Achieve sub-10ms click timing accuracy and <50MB RAM usage targets
5. **Advanced CPS Randomization** - Human-like timing patterns with configurable variance to avoid detection patterns

## Out of Scope

- Multi-point clicking sequences (Phase 2 feature)
- Image recognition capabilities (Phase 4 feature)
- Cloud sync or sharing functionality (Phase 5 feature)
- Scripting or conditional logic (Phase 2 feature)
- Application-specific presets (Phase 2 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional pause/resume controls** - User can pause active automation and resume with preserved state
2. **Working preset system** - User can save configurations with custom names and load them successfully
3. **Automatic error recovery** - System handles common errors gracefully and continues operation when possible
4. **Performance benchmarks met** - Sub-10ms timing accuracy achieved and validated through testing
5. **Production-ready stability** - All Phase 1 features working reliably for extended usage sessions
