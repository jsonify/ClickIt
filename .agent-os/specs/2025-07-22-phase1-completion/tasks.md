  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for pause/resume button components and state management
  - [x] 1.2 Add pause/resume buttons to main automation control panel in ClickItViewModel
  - [x] 1.3 Integrate pause/resume functionality with ElapsedTimeManager and ClickCoordinator
  - [x] 1.4 Update visual feedback overlay to reflect pause/resume states
  - [x] 1.5 Ensure session statistics preservation during pause state
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all tests pass and UI responds correctly

- [ ] 2. **Build Enhanced Preset Management System**
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for PresetManager and PresetConfiguration data structures
  - [ ] 2.2 Create PresetManager class with UserDefaults integration for save/load functionality
  - [ ] 2.3 Design and implement preset management UI components (save, load, delete, custom naming)
  - [ ] 2.4 Add preset validation logic to ensure saved configurations are valid
  - [ ] 2.5 Integrate preset system with ClickItViewModel and all configuration properties
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement preset selection dropdown and management interface
  - [ ] 2.7 Add preset export/import capability for backup and sharing
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify all tests pass and preset system works end-to-end

- [ ] 3. **Develop Comprehensive Error Recovery System**
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for ErrorRecoveryManager and error detection mechanisms
  - [ ] 3.2 Create ErrorRecoveryManager to monitor system state and handle failures
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement automatic retry logic for click failures and permission issues
  - [ ] 3.4 Add error notification system with clear user feedback and recovery status
  - [ ] 3.5 Integrate error recovery hooks into ClickCoordinator and automation loops
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement graceful degradation strategies when recovery fails
  - [ ] 3.7 Add system health monitoring for permissions and resource availability
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify all tests pass and error recovery works under failure conditions

- [ ] 4. **Optimize Performance for Sub-10ms Timing**
  - [ ] 4.1 Write performance benchmark tests for timing accuracy and resource usage
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement HighPrecisionTimer system with optimized timing loops
  - [ ] 4.3 Profile and optimize memory usage to meet <50MB RAM target
  - [ ] 4.4 Optimize CPU usage to achieve <5% idle target with efficient background processing
  - [ ] 4.5 Add real-time performance monitoring and metrics collection
  - [ ] 4.6 Implement automated performance validation and regression testing
  - [ ] 4.7 Create performance dashboard for user visibility into timing accuracy
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all performance targets met and benchmarks pass consistently

- [ ] 5. **Implement Advanced CPS Randomization**
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for CPSRandomizer and timing pattern generation
  - [ ] 5.2 Create CPSRandomizer with configurable variance and distribution patterns
  - [ ] 5.3 Add UI controls for randomization settings and pattern selection
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement statistical distributions (normal, uniform) for natural timing variation
  - [ ] 5.5 Integrate randomization with AutomationConfiguration and clicking loops
  - [ ] 5.6 Add validation to ensure randomization doesn't break timing requirements
  - [ ] 5.7 Implement anti-detection patterns to avoid automation signature detection
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass and randomization produces human-like patterns
