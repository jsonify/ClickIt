  - [ ] 6.3 Add UI controls for randomization settings and pattern selection
  - [ ] 6.4 Implement statistical distributions (normal, uniform) for natural timing variation
  - [ ] 6.5 Integrate randomization with AutomationConfiguration and clicking loops
  - [ ] 6.6 Add validation to ensure randomization doesn't break timing requirements
  - [ ] 6.7 Implement anti-detection patterns to avoid automation signature detection
  - [ ] 6.8 Verify all tests pass and randomization produces human-like patterns
