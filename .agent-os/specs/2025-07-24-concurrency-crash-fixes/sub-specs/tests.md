### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Real-World Permission Management**
1. Open ClickIt application
2. Navigate to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
3. Toggle ClickIt permission OFF
4. Verify app continues running, UI updates correctly
5. Toggle ClickIt permission ON
6. Verify app functions normally, no crashes or errors
7. Repeat cycle 10 times rapidly
8. Confirm consistent behavior and stability

**Concurrency Stress Testing**
1. Start clicking automation with high CPS rate
2. While clicking is active, toggle Accessibility permission
3. Verify automation stops/resumes correctly without crashes
4. Test with multiple simultaneous actions (clicking + permission changes)
5. Monitor for any MainActor-related warnings or crashes
