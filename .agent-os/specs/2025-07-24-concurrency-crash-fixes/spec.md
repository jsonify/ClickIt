> Spec: Critical Concurrency Crash Fixes
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical concurrency race conditions in timer callbacks and app initialization that cause immediate app crashes when Accessibility permissions are toggled ON/OFF, while preserving all advanced functionality implemented since version 1.4.15.

## User Stories

### Application Stability Recovery

As a ClickIt user, I want to toggle Accessibility permissions ON/OFF in System Settings without the app crashing, so that I can manage permissions normally and continue using the application reliably.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User opens ClickIt application successfully
2. User opens System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
3. User toggles ClickIt permission OFF then ON (or vice versa)
4. Application continues running without crashes
5. Permission status updates correctly in the UI
6. All timer-based functionality continues working properly

### Developer Debugging Experience

As a developer debugging ClickIt, I want clear concurrency patterns that follow Swift's MainActor isolation rules, so that I can maintain and extend the codebase without introducing race conditions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer identifies concurrency issues in timer callbacks
2. Fixed patterns use proper MainActor isolation without nested tasks
3. Code is maintainable and follows Swift concurrency best practices
4. Future timer implementations follow established safe patterns

### Preservation of Advanced Features

As a ClickIt user, I want all advanced features implemented since version 1.4.15 to continue working exactly as before, so that the stability fix doesn't break any existing functionality.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. All timer automation continues with sub-10ms precision
2. Permission monitoring works correctly without crashes
3. Visual feedback system remains fully functional
4. All UI panels and controls work as expected

## Spec Scope

1. **PermissionManager Concurrency Fix** - Replace problematic `Task { @MainActor in }` pattern in timer callback (line 190-194)
2. **TimerAutomationEngine High-Precision Timer Fix** - Fix MainActor race condition in HighPrecisionTimer callback (lines 288-292)
3. **TimerAutomationEngine Status Update Timer Fix** - Fix concurrency issue in status update timer (lines 389-393)
4. **ClickItApp Initialization Fix** - Resolve MainActor task conflict in app initialization (lines 18-20)
5. **Validation Testing** - Comprehensive testing to ensure crashes are eliminated during permission toggling

## Out of Scope

- Rewriting the entire timer system architecture
- Changing the MainActor isolation strategy for classes
- Modifying the permission monitoring frequency or behavior
- Altering any user-facing functionality or UI behavior
- Performance optimizations beyond fixing the race conditions

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Crash-Free Permission Toggling** - App no longer crashes when Accessibility permissions are toggled in System Settings
2. **Proper MainActor Patterns** - All timer callbacks use safe concurrency patterns compatible with @MainActor classes
3. **Preserved Functionality** - All existing features work identically to pre-fix behavior
4. **Code Quality Improvement** - Cleaner, more maintainable concurrency patterns following Swift best practices
5. **Comprehensive Testing Validation** - Thorough testing confirms stability across permission state changes
