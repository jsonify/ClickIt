> Spec: Timer Automation System & Duration Controls
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete the core timer automation engine for ClickIt's MVP Phase 1, focusing on robust automation loops with comprehensive duration controls and reliable timer management. This includes enhanced start/stop/pause functionality, time-based and click-count stopping mechanisms, and advanced timer precision validation.

## User Stories

### Timer Automation Engine
As a user who needs reliable automation for extended periods, I want a robust timer system that can run automation loops continuously with precise timing control, so that I can depend on consistent automation performance for critical tasks.

**Detailed Workflow:** User configures click settings and duration parameters, starts automation, timer engine maintains precise timing while executing clicks, automation continues reliably until duration limits are reached or user manually stops, session statistics are preserved throughout operation.

### Duration Controls System
As a user running automation for specific time periods or click counts, I want flexible duration controls that can stop automation based on time elapsed or total clicks performed, so that I can precisely control how long automation runs without manual monitoring.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sets duration limit (e.g., "run for 30 minutes" or "perform 1000 clicks"), starts automation, system tracks elapsed time and click count in real-time, automation automatically stops when either limit is reached, user receives clear notification of completion with final statistics.

### Click Validation System
As a user depending on automation accuracy, I want the system to validate that clicks are being executed successfully and provide feedback when issues occur, so that I can trust the automation is working correctly and troubleshoot problems quickly.

**Detailed Workflow:** User starts automation, system monitors each click execution for success/failure, provides real-time feedback on click accuracy and success rate, alerts user if click failure rate becomes unacceptable, offers suggestions for resolving click validation issues.

## Spec Scope

1. **Timer Automation Engine** - Core automation loops with start/stop/pause functionality and precise timing control
2. **Duration Controls** - Time-based and click-count stopping mechanisms with real-time tracking
3. **Click Validation** - Success verification and failure detection with user feedback
4. **Settings Export/Import** - Backup and restore configurations for reliability and sharing

## Out of Scope

- Multi-point clicking sequences (Phase 2 feature)
- Image recognition capabilities (Phase 4 feature)
- Advanced scheduling features (Phase 4 feature)
- Workflow automation with branching logic (Phase 4 feature)
- Machine learning adaptive patterns (Phase 4 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Robust Timer Engine** - Reliable automation loops with sub-10ms timing accuracy and comprehensive state management
2. **Flexible Duration Controls** - Time and click-count based stopping with real-time progress tracking
3. **Click Validation System** - Success verification with failure detection and user feedback mechanisms
4. **Settings Management** - Export/import capability for configuration backup and sharing
5. **Production-Ready Stability** - All timer features working reliably for extended automation sessions
