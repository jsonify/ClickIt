> Spec: Enhanced "Refresh Status" Button
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance ClickIt's "Refresh Status" button to actually reset accessibility permissions in System Settings rather than just rechecking current status. This improvement will automatically remove stale permission entries and trigger fresh authorization dialogs for the current app instance, significantly improving the development workflow and user experience.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Workflow

As a developer testing ClickIt builds, I want to click "Refresh Status" and have it reset my accessibility permissions, so that I can quickly test with fresh permissions without manually managing System Settings entries.

The developer workflow involves frequent rebuilds during development, which can leave multiple "ClickIt" entries in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. Currently, the refresh button only rechecks status, requiring manual cleanup of old entries. This enhancement will automate that cleanup and immediately prompt for fresh permissions.

### User Permission Troubleshooting

As a user experiencing permission issues, I want to click "Refresh Status" and have it resolve permission conflicts, so that I can get ClickIt working without complex manual troubleshooting.

Users sometimes encounter situations where ClickIt shows permission problems despite appearing enabled in System Settings. This typically happens when app signatures change or multiple app versions exist. The enhanced button will resolve these conflicts automatically.

## Spec Scope

1. **Smart Permission Reset** - Use `tccutil reset Accessibility` to clear current app's permission entry
2. **Automatic Re-authorization** - Trigger fresh permission dialog immediately after reset
3. **Enhanced UI Feedback** - Show loading state and progress during reset operation
4. **Error Recovery** - Graceful fallback to standard refresh if reset fails
5. **User Experience Flow** - Seamless single-click operation with clear status feedback

## Out of Scope

- Screen Recording permission reset (focus only on Accessibility)
- Bulk permission management for multiple apps
- Advanced permission diagnostics or system-wide permission tools
- Migration of existing permission settings

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced "Refresh Status" button that successfully resets and re-requests Accessibility permissions
2. Improved permission management workflow that eliminates manual System Settings cleanup
3. Robust error handling that maintains existing functionality as fallback when reset fails
