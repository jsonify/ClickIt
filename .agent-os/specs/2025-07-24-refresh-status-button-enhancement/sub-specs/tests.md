# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-refresh-status-button-enhancement/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**PermissionManager**
- Test `resetAccessibilityPermission()` with valid bundle ID
- Test `resetAccessibilityPermission()` with missing bundle ID
- Test `refreshWithReset()` success and failure scenarios
- Test Process execution error handling and timeout behavior
- Test permission status updates after reset operations

**PermissionsGateView**
- Test UI state changes during refresh operation (loading states)
- Test error message display and auto-clearing behavior
- Test button disabled state during operation
- Test refresh operation triggering and completion

### Integration Tests

**Permission Reset Flow**
- Test complete reset → re-request → status update workflow
- Test fallback behavior when tccutil command fails
- Test permission dialog appearance after successful reset
- Test UI updates when user grants/denies permission in dialog

**Error Recovery Scenarios**
- Test behavior when tccutil is not available or fails
- Test timeout handling for long-running reset operations
- Test network or system errors during permission requests
- Test graceful degradation to standard refresh functionality

**User Experience Flow**
- Test single-click operation from start to completion
- Test loading indicator appearance and timing
- Test error message display and auto-clearing (5-second timeout)
- Test button re-enabling after operation completion

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Permission Reset Validation**
- Verify old ClickIt entries are removed from System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- Verify fresh permission dialog appears after reset
- Verify app functions correctly after granting fresh permissions
- Verify no impact on other applications' accessibility permissions

**Development Workflow Testing**
- Test with multiple ClickIt app instances/builds
- Test permission reset between different development builds
- Verify improved developer experience vs. manual cleanup
- Test code signing changes and permission persistence

**Error Condition Testing**
- Test with denied system permissions (if possible to simulate)
- Test with corrupted TCC database (edge case)
- Test with restricted user accounts or enterprise MDM policies
- Test fallback behavior maintains existing app functionality

## Mocking Requirements

**Process Execution**
- Mock `Process` class to simulate tccutil command success/failure
- Mock system command execution with configurable exit codes
- Mock process timeout scenarios for error handling validation

**Permission System**
- Mock accessibility permission checking APIs
- Mock permission request dialogs and user responses
- Mock bundle identifier retrieval for edge case testing

**System State**
- Mock TCC database states (permission granted/denied/not set)
- Mock system settings to simulate various permission configurations
- Mock network connectivity issues that might affect permission requests

## Test Data Requirements

**Bundle Identifiers**
- Valid bundle ID: `com.jsonify.ClickIt`
- Invalid/nil bundle ID for error testing
- Bundle IDs from other applications for security validation

**System Commands**
- Mock tccutil responses for various scenarios
- Simulated command execution timings
- Error outputs and exit codes from system utilities

## Automated Test Strategy

**CI/CD Integration**
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on pull requests
- Manual testing scenarios documented for release validation
- Performance testing for UI responsiveness during reset operations

**Test Environment Setup**
- Mock system permissions for consistent testing
- Isolated test environment that doesn't affect real system settings
- Automated cleanup of test artifacts and system state

## Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements**
- All unit tests pass with >90% code coverage
- Integration tests verify complete permission reset workflow
- Manual testing confirms improved user experience
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully without app crashes

**Performance Requirements**
- Permission reset operation completes within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- UI remains responsive during reset operations
- No memory leaks or resource issues during repeated operations
- Fallback to standard refresh occurs within 1 second of detecting reset failure

**Security Requirements**
- Only current app's bundle ID is affected by reset operations
- No unintended system changes or security bypasses
- Process execution is properly sandboxed and secured
- Error messages don't expose sensitive system information
